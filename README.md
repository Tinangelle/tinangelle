Hi there, I'm 33 👋

Founder & Lead Developer at Ignis Solaris Studio Inc.

I'm the founder of Ignis Solaris Studio, an indie studio grounded in psychology, dedicated to providing "micro-healing" through narrative-driven games. We focus on contemporary players facing "universal loneliness" and "efficiency anxiety," aiming to create psychological sanctuaries where players feel "unconditionally loved."

🌱 What I'm Building

🎮 Back to Thawing Valley

Our debut title is a simulation game that rejects utilitarian socializing and repetitive labour. It empowers players as a "Town Leader" with creative and community-building power.

Status: Public Demo in development.
